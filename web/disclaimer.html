                at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services

              <li>
                Let&#8217;s Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. 
                Before filing a claim against VAMDC, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting support@vamdc.eu. 
                We&#8217;ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, 
                you or VAMDC may bring a formal proceeding.
              </li>
              <li>
            We both agree to use mediation. You and VAMDC agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services 
            with mediation through the VAMDC Consortium &laquo; Legal Committee &raquo;.

            Entire Agreement
            <ul>
              <li>
                These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and VAMDC with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, 
                and supersede and replace any other prior agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. 
                These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, 
                you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

            Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment
            <ul>
              <li>
                VAMDC failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. 
                If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted 
                reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. 
                VAMDC may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
