        <h2>VAMDC Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
          When you use VAMDC services, we may collect some personal data (your IP address and if you provide it, your e-mail). Those data are used only to offer you the service in question, nothing else. VAMDC does not disclose, give or sell your data to anyone unless we are required to do so pursuant to a mandatory provision of law. 
          We may use some of the data in research and development work to improve our services, but for such purposes we always use the data in a fully anonymized form, and no personal identifiers are left in the data.
          Your data is stored on VAMDC ecosystem servers, which are located in the EU. 
        </p>
        <h3>Storage and accuracy of information</h3>
        <p>
          We only store the information as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or required by law. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.
          For any question, you may also contact use: <a href="http://www.vamdc.org/contact/contact-category-1/">http://www.vamdc.org/contact/contact-category-1/</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          There are always risks associated with providing personal data via the internet and no system or technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof. VAMDC takes appropriate precautions to prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of your personal data: we use industry standard security measures.
        </p>
        <h3>Your rights</h3>
        <p>
          You always have the right to access your personal information. You have the right to know what information pertaining to you has been collected, what this information is used for. To verify your identity in order to carry out your request, we may have to ask for additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
          VAMDC is allowed to handle your personal information when the handling is based on a legitimate interest. We use this legal basis in some cases for our research and development activities, as we constantly want to develop and improve our services. You have the right to object to the handling of your personal information for these purposes. However, your right to object is not absolute. The data used in our research and development work is anonymized and cannot be associated with you. 
          You have the right to have any of your information corrected or deleted 
          If you want to have your information deleted, we will delete your user credentials and all information and data pertaining to you. The deleted data is not retrievable. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you suspect misuse of the information, you may submit a complaint to the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/">European data protection board</a> or a similar authority.
